This project was created in January 2024 for the period of 1 working day. It's made by following GameDev tv's "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners" course on Udemy. One of the modules was teaching some key concepts with the step-by-step guide on building the game.

## Specifics of the game:

- Open the .exe file in the main directory to play the game
- The project was developed using the Raylib library and Visual Studio Code
- **Goal of the game:** jump over the nebula obstacles and don't touch or fall on them. The default number of nebulas is 5, so when you jump over all 5 of them, you win. If you touch one - you lose. You can change this number by modifying the variable "const int sizeOfNebulae=5;" in the "dasher.cpp" file. Delete the number 5 and add as many obstacles as you like.

Game control keyboard keys: (classical ones were chosen)

```sh
space -> JUMP
```
